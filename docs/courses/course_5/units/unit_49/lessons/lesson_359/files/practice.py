# Problem 1: Factorial of a Number
# Write a Python program that:
# 1. Takes a positive integer as input from the user.
# 2. Calculates and prints the factorial of that number.
# Example:
# Enter a number: 5
# Factorial of 5 is: 120

# Problem 2: Count Vowels in a String
# Write a Python program that:
# 1. Takes a string as input from the user.
# 2. Counts and prints the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.
# Example:
# Enter a string: programming
# Number of vowels: 3

# Problem 3: Fibonacci Sequence
# Write a Python program that:
# 1. Takes an integer n as input from the user.
# 2. Generates and prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
# Example:
# Enter the number of terms: 6
# Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5

# Problem 4: Find the Second Largest Number
# Write a Python program that:
# 1. Takes a list of numbers as input (e.g., [10, 20, 4, 45, 99]).
# 2. Finds and prints the second largest number in the list.
# Example:
# List: [10, 20, 4, 45, 99]
# Second largest number: 45
