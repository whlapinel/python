def main():
    #### Task 1: Load a large dataset (you can download any dataset from online data repositories like Kaggle)
    #### For example, use a dataset on 'Video Game Sales' or any other dataset of interest
    #### Task 2: Filter the dataset to include only the entries with sales greater than 1 million units
    #### Task 3: Create a new column that categorizes the sales into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High'
    #### Task 4: Merge this dataset with another dataset that includes additional information
    #### For example, merge with a dataset that includes developer information
    #### Task 5: Create a scatter plot of two numerical variables from the dataset
    #### Task 6: Create a histogram of a numerical column, e.g., global sales
