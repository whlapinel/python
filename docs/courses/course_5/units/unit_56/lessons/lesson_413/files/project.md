# Capstone Project Overview

Apply what you’ve learned in data science by exploring and analyzing a dataset, either from the listed provided or a different one of your choosing. Your goal is to answer specific questions about the data, create visualizations, and share insights. You will submit one Jupyter notebook containing the requirements below.

# Project Steps and Requirements

1. **Dataset Selection and Proposal**
   - Choose a dataset from the list provided or another approved dataset.
   - Define one main question to guide your analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Handle missing data, and identify any outliers.
   - Include at least two methods to clean or preprocess your data.

# Project Requirements (cont'd)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Use two or more visualizations to explore relationships or patterns.
   - Answer at least one question based on your EDA.

4. **Analysis and Insights**
   - Apply one analysis technique (e.g., regression or classification).
   - Summarize key findings in one or two paragraphs.

5. **Conclusion**
   - Describe your main insights and any surprising findings.

# Suggested Guiding Questions for Datasets Below

1. **Iris Dataset**: What features help most in distinguishing iris species?
2. **Titanic Dataset**: Which factors most influence survival?
3. **Penguins Dataset**: How do penguin species differ in size and location?
4. **Wine Quality Dataset**: Which attributes correlate most with wine quality?
5. **Boston Housing Dataset**: What influences housing prices the most?
6. **Netflix Dataset**: How have genres changed over time?
7. **Students Performance**: What factors most affect test scores?
8. **Supermarket Sales**: What trends are seen in sales across days or times?
9. **NYC Taxi Rides**: What influences trip durations most?
10. **Chocolate Ratings**: What attributes correlate with higher chocolate ratings?
