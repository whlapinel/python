### Exercise 1: Write to a File
# Write a Python script that creates a file called `students.txt` and writes the names of five students (one per line) to the file.
# **Steps:**
# 1. Create a list of five student names.
# 2. Open a file in write mode.
# 3. Write each name to the file, each on a new line.
# 4. Close the file.

### Exercise 2: Read from a File
# Write a Python script that reads the content of `students.txt` created in the previous exercise and prints each studentâ€™s name.
# **Steps:**
# 1. Open the file `students.txt` in read mode.
# 2. Read each line from the file.
# 3. Print the content of the file line by line.

### Exercise 3: Append to a File
# Modify the `students.txt` file by adding two more student names to the end of the file without overwriting the existing names.
# **Steps:**
# 1. Open the file `students.txt` in append mode.
# 2. Write two more names to the file.
# 3. Close the file.

### Exercise 4: Copy File Contents
# Write a Python script that reads the contents of `students.txt` and writes them to a new file called `students_copy.txt`.
# **Steps:**
# 1. Open `students.txt` in read mode.
# 2. Open a new file `students_copy.txt` in write mode.
# 3. Read the contents of `students.txt` and write them to `students_copy.txt`.


### Exercise 5: Count Words in a File
# Write a Python script that reads the content of `students.txt` and counts how many words (names) are in the file.
# **Steps:**
# 1. Open `students.txt` in read mode.
# 2. Read the entire content and split it into words.
# 3. Count the words and print the total.
