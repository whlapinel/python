# **Warmup**

Write a function word_lengths that takes a list of words and returns a dictionary where the keys are the words, and the values are the lengths of those words.

**Example**

```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "pear"]

assert word_lengths(words) == {"apple": 5, "banana": 6, "pear": 4}
```
