# Assignment 2.5

## Instructions
- Complete the problems below and submit as a python file.

### **Basic Bitwise Operations**
1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**  
   - Compute `12 & 9` and explain the result.
   - Write a function that takes two integers and returns their bitwise AND.

2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**  
   - Compute `6 | 3` and explain the result.
   - Write a function that takes two integers and returns their bitwise OR.

3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**  
   - Compute `7 ^ 5` and explain the result.
   - Write a function that returns `True` if two integers have at least one different bit and `False` otherwise.

4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**  
   - Compute `~4` and explain the result.
   - Write a function that returns the bitwise NOT of a number.

### **Shifting Bits**
5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**  
   - Compute `5 << 2` and explain what happens.
   - Write a function that multiplies a number by `2^n` using the left shift operator.

6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**  
   - Compute `16 >> 3` and explain what happens.
   - Write a function that divides a number by `2^n` using the right shift operator.

### **Intermediate Challenges**
7. **Even or Odd Check (without `%` or `//`)**  
   - Write a function to check if a number is even using bitwise operators.

8. **Swapping Two Numbers Without a Temporary Variable**  
   - Swap two numbers using only bitwise XOR.

9. **Count the Number of 1s in a Binary Representation**  
   - Write a function that counts the number of `1`s in the binary representation of an integer.

10. **Find the Only Non-Repeating Element**  
    - Given a list where every number appears twice except one, find the single unique number using bitwise XOR.

11. **Power of Two Check**  
    - Write a function that returns `True` if a number is a power of two using bitwise operators.

12. **Bitwise Masking**  
    - Given an integer, write a function that extracts only the last four bits.
