# Python Problems: Nested Loops & Complex Conditionals

# Nested Loops Problems

# Multiplication Table:
# Write a program that prints a 10x10 multiplication table using nested loops.

# Right-Aligned Triangle:
# Print a right-aligned triangle of * with a height given by the user.

# Pascal’s Triangle:
# Generate the first n rows of Pascal’s Triangle using nested loops.

# Matrix Addition:
# Given two 3x3 matrices, compute their sum using nested loops.

# FizzBuzz Grid:
# Print a 5x5 grid where each cell follows the FizzBuzz rule (divisible by 3 = 'Fizz', by 5 = 'Buzz', by both = 'FizzBuzz').

# Pattern Printing:
# Write a program that prints the following pattern for n=4:

# 1
# 1 2
# 1 2 3
# 1 2 3 4

# Prime Numbers in a Range:
# Print all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using nested loops.

# Sudoku Row Checker:
# Given a 9x9 list of lists, verify that each row contains unique numbers from 1-9.

# Complex Conditional Problems

# Age Categorization:
# Given a list of ages, classify each as 'Child' (0-12), 'Teen' (13-19), 'Adult' (20-64), or 'Senior' (65+).

# Triangle Type Classifier:
# Write a program that takes three side lengths and determines if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

# Leap Year Checker:
# Given a year, determine if it is a leap year using conditional logic.

# Password Strength Checker:
# Check if a password is strong (at least 8 characters, contains uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character).

# Grade Calculation:
# Given a percentage, return a letter grade (A-F) with conditional logic.

# Shopping Discount System:
# If a customer spends over $100, they get a 10% discount. If they are a member, they get an additional 5%. Calculate the final price.

# Weather Advisory:
# Given the temperature and precipitation status, advise whether to 'Wear a Jacket', 'Take an Umbrella', or 'Enjoy the Sun'.
