# 1. Create a dictionary representing a person with keys "name", "age", and "city". Print the dictionary.

# 2. Add a new key "job" with a value to the dictionary and print the updated dictionary.

# 3. Remove the "age" key from the dictionary and print the result.

# 4. Retrieve the value of "city" safely using `.get()` and print it.

# 5. Loop through the dictionary and print each key and value.

# 6. Merge two dictionaries: {"a": 1, "b": 2} and {"c": 3, "d": 4}.

# 7. Create a dictionary comprehension that maps numbers 1 to 5 to their squares.

# 8. Create a dictionary comprehension that maps each letter in "hello" to its ASCII value.

# 9. Given a dictionary `{1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c"}`, create a new dictionary swapping keys and values.

# 10. Use a dictionary comprehension to filter out key-value pairs where the key is even from `{1:10, 2:20, 3:30, 4:40, 5:50}`.

# 11. Create a list comprehension that generates a list of squares for numbers 1 to 10.

# 12. Create a list comprehension that extracts vowels from the string "comprehension".

# 13. Create a list comprehension that generates a list of even numbers from 1 to 20.

# 14. Create a set comprehension that extracts unique consonants from the string "dictionary".

# 15. Create a dictionary comprehension that maps numbers 1-10 to "even" or "odd" depending on their parity.
