# Practice Problems: `for` Loops with Lists

---

## Problem 1: Print All Elements
### **Task:**
Write a `for` loop that prints each element in the list:
```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
```

**Hint:** Loop directly over the list to access each element.

---

## Problem 2: Double the Numbers
### **Task:**
Given a list of numbers, use a `for` loop to double each number and print the new values.
```python
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Hint:** Modify each element by multiplying by `2` before printing.

---

## Problem 3: Find Even Numbers
### **Task:**
Write a `for` loop that prints only the even numbers from the list:
```python
values = [5, 12, 17, 24, 39, 40]
```

**Hint:** Use the modulus operator `%` to check if a number is even.

---

## Problem 4: Counting Characters
### **Task:**
Given a list of words, use a `for` loop to print each word along with its length.
```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
```

**Hint:** Use the `len()` function to get the length of each word.

---

## Problem 5: Reverse List Printing
### **Task:**
Print all elements of the list **in reverse order**.
```python
items = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```

**Hint:** Use slicing (`[::-1]`) or loop backward using `range()`.

---

## Problem 6: Replace Negative Numbers
### **Task:**
Replace all negative numbers in a list with `0`.
```python
numbers = [3, -1, 5, -9, 8]
```

**Hint:** Loop through the indices using `range(len(numbers))` to modify elements.

---

## Problem 7: Create a New List
### **Task:**
Use a `for` loop to create a new list containing only the positive numbers from the given list.
```python
nums = [-10, 15, -3, 8, 0, 22]
```

**Hint:** Use an empty list and `append()` the positive numbers.

---

## Problem 8: Find the Largest Number
### **Task:**
Find and print the largest number in a list.
```python
values = [42, 17, 56, 23, 88, 34]
```

**Hint:** Use a variable to track the largest value and update it during iteration.

---

## Problem 9: Count Occurrences
### **Task:**
Count how many times the number `3` appears in the list.
```python
numbers = [3, 7, 3, 2, 3, 9, 3]
```

**Hint:** Use a counter variable and increment it inside the loop when `3` is found.

---

## Problem 10: Concatenate Strings
### **Task:**
Join all strings in the list into a single string and print the result.
```python
words = ["Hello", "world", "Python", "rocks"]
```
