# 1. Print Odd Numbers:
# Write a while loop that prints all odd numbers from 1 to 25.

# 2. Repeat Until Uppercase:
# Ask the user to enter a word. If the word is not in uppercase, keep asking until they enter an all-uppercase word.

# 3. Multiplication Table:
# Take an integer input from the user and use a while loop to print its multiplication table up to 10 (e.g., for 3: 3, 6, 9, ..., 30).

# 4. Factorial Calculation:
# Use a while loop to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.

# 5. Sum of Digits:
# Given an integer input from the user, use a while loop to find the sum of its digits.

# 6. Reverse a Number:
# Write a while loop that reverses the digits of a user-provided number (e.g., 1234 â†’ 4321).

# 7. Repeat Until Palindrome:
# Continuously ask the user for a word until they enter a palindrome (a word that reads the same forward and backward).

# 8. Divide Until 1:
# Take a number from the user and repeatedly divide it by 2 until it becomes less than or equal to 1, printing each step.

# 9. Count Letter Frequency:
# Given a string input from the user, use a while loop to count how many times the letter 'e' appears in the string.

# 10. Number Guesser with Hints:
# Implement a guessing game where the user must guess a predefined number. Instead of just repeating until correct, provide hints like "Too high" or "Too low".
