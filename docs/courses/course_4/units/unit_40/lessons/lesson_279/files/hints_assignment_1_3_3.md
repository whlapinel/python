# Hints for `for` Loop Practice Problems

## Problem 1
**Hint:** Use the `range()` function to generate numbers from 1 to 10.

## Problem 2
**Hint:** The exponentiation operator `**` can be used to calculate squares.

## Problem 3
**Hint:** The loop should run a fixed number of times, and inside the loop, print the message.

## Problem 4
**Hint:** Odd numbers follow a pattern. Try adjusting the `range()` function to only generate odd values.

## Problem 5
**Hint:** The `range()` function can count backward if given the correct step value.

## Problem 6
**Hint:** Strings are iterable, and each iteration gives a single character.

## Problem 7
**Hint:** Use an `if` statement inside the loop to check for 13 and use `break` to exit early.

## Problem 8
**Hint:** Use `continue` to skip over the number 5 while still iterating over the rest.

## Problem 9
**Hint:** Multiples of 3 follow a pattern. Think about adjusting the start, stop, and step in `range()`.

## Problem 10
**Hint:** The `else` block can be used with `for` loops to indicate successful completion of the loop.
