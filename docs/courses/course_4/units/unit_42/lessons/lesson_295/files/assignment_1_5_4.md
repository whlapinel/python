# Assignment 5.4: Practice Problems with Sets

## ðŸŸ¢ **Basic Problems** (required)
1. **Create a Set**  
   Create a set containing the numbers 1 through 5. Then, add the number 6 and remove the number 2.

2. **Check Membership**  
   Write a function `is_in_set(s, element)` that returns `True` if `element` is in the set `s`, otherwise `False`.

3. **Set Length**  
   Create a set with five different elements. Write a function `set_length(s)` that returns the number of elements in the set.

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate Problems** (optional)
4. **Remove Duplicates**  
   Write a function `remove_duplicates(lst)` that takes a list and returns a set of unique elements.

5. **Set Union and Intersection**
   Write a function `union_and_intersection(set1, set2)` that returns a tuple of two sets:
   - First set = union of `set1` and `set2`
   - Second set = intersection of `set1` and `set2`

6. **Difference and Symmetric Difference**  
   Write a function `difference_and_symmetric_difference(set1, set2)` that returns a tuple of two sets:
   - First set = elements in `set1` but not in `set2`
   - Second set = elements in either set but not both  

## ðŸ”´ **Advanced Problems** (optional)
7. **Unique Characters**  
   Write a function `unique_characters(s)` that takes a string and returns a set of unique characters.

8. **Common Elements Across Multiple Sets**  
   Write a function `common_elements(*sets)` that takes any number of sets and returns a set of elements common to all of them.

9. **Subset and Superset**  
   Write a function `is_subset(small, large)` that returns `True` if `small` is a subset of `large`.

10. **Find Missing Elements**  
   Write a function `missing_elements(full_set, present_set)` that returns a set of elements that are in `full_set` but not in `present_set`.
