# Python 1 Assignment 5.2: Practice with Tuples and Lists

## **List Slicing Practice Problems**  

1. **Basic Slicing**  
   - Create a list of the numbers `1 to 10`.  
   - Print the first 5 elements using slicing.  

2. **Negative Indexing**  
   - Create a list of the letters in your name.  
   - Use negative indexing to print the last 3 letters.  

3. **Step Slicing**  
   - Create a list of even numbers from `2 to 20`.  
   - Use slicing to print every second element.  

4. **Reverse Slicing**  
   - Create a list of numbers from `1 to 5`.  
   - Use slicing to print the list in reverse order.  

5. **Modify a Slice**  
   - Create a list of numbers from `1 to 10`.  
   - Replace the middle three numbers with `[100, 200, 300]`.  
   - Print the modified list.  

## **Tuple Practice Problems**

1. **Create and Access Tuples**  
   - Create a tuple named `person` containing your name, age, and favorite color.  
   - Print the second element of the tuple.  

2. **Unpacking Tuples**  
   - Create a tuple with three numbers.  
   - Unpack the values into three separate variables and print them.  

3. **Tuple Concatenation and Repetition**  
   - Create two tuples: `a = (1, 2)` and `b = (3, 4)`.  
   - Concatenate them into a new tuple `c` and print it.  
   - Repeat `a` three times and print the result.  

4. **Tuple Methods**  
   - Create a tuple: `t = (5, 3, 5, 2, 5, 1)`  
   - Find how many times `5` appears using a tuple method.  
   - Find the index of the first occurrence of `2` using a tuple method.  

5. **Tuple Conversion**  
   - Create a list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`  
   - Convert it to a tuple and print it.  
   - Try to change the second value â€” what happens?
