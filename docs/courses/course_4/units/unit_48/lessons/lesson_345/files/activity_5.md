# **Activity 5: Grouping Data by Sensor**

**Goal**: Learn to group data by key (e.g., sensor ID).

**Task**:

1. Provide logs like:

   ```log
   [2025-01-15 07:12:00] SENSOR #001 Temperature 72.5
   [2025-01-15 07:15:00] SENSOR #001 Temperature 90.2
   [2025-01-15 07:13:00] SENSOR #002 Temperature 70.9
   ```

2. Group temperatures by sensor ID in a dictionary.
