# **Activity 2: Log Parsing Basics**

**Goal**: Practice identifying and counting specific log types.

**Task**:

1. Provide a small log file (`logs.log`) with data like:

   ```text
   [2025-01-15 07:12:00] SENSOR #001 Temperature 72.5
   [2025-01-15 07:14:00] ALERT Overheating in sensor #001
   [2025-01-15 07:16:00] ERROR Sensor #002 offline
   ```

2. Count how many lines contain `SENSOR`, `ALERT`, and `ERROR`.

3. Print the counts.
