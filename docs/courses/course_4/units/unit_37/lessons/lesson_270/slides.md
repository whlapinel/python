# Lesson 0.3

# Warmup

```text
/python
  /unit_0
    /lesson_2
```

- Create a new directory called `lesson_2` in your `unit_0` directory.
- Open this directory in VS Code and create a new file called `warmup.py`
- Copy and paste the following into your file

```python
x = 10
y = x
x = 20
print(y)
```

Is the output 10 or 20?  Why is this the value of y?

# Python in Context

# History and Development of Python

# Origins of Python
- **Created by**: Guido van Rossum
- **First Released**: 1991
- **Inspiration**: ABC language
- **Goal**: To create a simple, readable, and versatile programming language

# Key Milestones in Python's Development
- **1991**: Python 0.9.0 released (initial version)
- **2000**: Python 2.0 released (introduced list comprehensions, garbage collection)
- **2008**: Python 3.0 released (backward-incompatible, focused on removing redundancies)
- **2020**: End of support for Python 2.7

# Python's Design Philosophy
- **Readability**: Emphasizes clean, readable code (PEP 20 - The Zen of Python)
- **Versatility**: Supports multiple programming paradigms (procedural, OOP, functional)
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source with a strong, active community

# Python's Place Among Programming Languages
- **Popularity**: Consistently ranks among the top programming languages (TIOBE, Stack Overflow surveys)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Web development (Django, Flask)
  - Data science (Pandas, NumPy)
  - Machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - Automation and scripting
- **Comparison**:
  - Easier to learn than C++ or Java
  - More versatile than R or MATLAB
  - Slower than C/C++ but highly productive

# Why Python Stands Out
- **Simplicity**: Easy to learn and use, even for beginners
- **Extensibility**: Large standard library and third-party packages
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more
- **Community Support**: Active forums, tutorials, and documentation

# Conclusion
- Python has evolved into one of the most popular and versatile programming languages.
- Its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem make it a top choice for developers worldwide.
