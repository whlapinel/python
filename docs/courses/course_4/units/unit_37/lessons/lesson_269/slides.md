# Ethics in Computer Science

## What is Ethics in CS?

- Ensuring technology is used responsibly.
- Avoiding harm (e.g., cybersecurity, misinformation, AI bias).

# Examples of Ethical Issues:

- Privacy concerns (e.g., Facebook data leaks).
- AI decision-making (e.g., biased hiring algorithms).
- Intellectual property (e.g., software piracy).

# Discussion Question:

How important should ethics be to the software industry?

# Security in Computer Science

Why Security Matters:

- Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- Preventing cyberattacks and data breaches.

## Common Security Threats:

- Phishing attacks (e.g., fake login pages).
- Malware and ransomware.
- Weak passwords and social engineering.

# Best Practices:

- Use strong encryption.
- Implement multi-factor authentication.
- Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities.

# History of Computer Science

Key Milestones:
1940s: First computers (e.g., ENIAC).
1970s: Personal computing revolution (e.g., Apple I, IBM PC).
1990s: Rise of the internet.
2000s-Present: AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity advancements.

# Important Figures:

Alan Turing – Father of modern computing.
Grace Hopper – Developed the first compiler.
Tim Berners-Lee – Invented the World Wide Web.

# Discussion:

How has computing changed in the last 20 years?
