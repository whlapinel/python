# # Assignment: Practicing `print()` and `input()`

# ## Instructions

# In this assignment, you will create a Python program that interacts with the user through `print()` and `input()` functions. You will also use basic data types and operators to process user input.

# ## Task 1: Getting to Know You

# 1. Write a program that asks the user for their **name** and **age**.
# 2. Print a greeting message including their name.
# 3. Calculate their age next year and print the result.

# ### Example Output:
# ```
# What is your name? Alice
# Hello, Alice!
# How old are you? 10
# Next year, you will be 11 years old.
# ```

# ## Task 2: Favorite Things

# 1. Ask the user for their favorite **color**, **food**, and **hobby**.
# 2. Print a sentence summarizing their answers.

# ### Example Output:
# ```
# What is your favorite color? Blue
# What is your favorite food? Pizza
# What is your favorite hobby? Reading
# Wow! You love Blue, enjoy eating Pizza, and have fun Reading!
# ```

# ## Task 3: Simple Math Quiz

# 1. Ask the user for two numbers.
# 2. Convert their inputs to integers.
# 3. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the numbers.
# 4. Print the results.

# ### Example Output:
# ```
# Enter the first number: 8
# Enter the second number: 2
# 8 + 2 = 10
# 8 - 2 = 6
# 8 * 2 = 16
# 8 / 2 = 4.0
# ```

# ## Task 4: Personalized Story

# 1. Ask the user for a **name**, an **animal**, and a **place**.
# 2. Print a short story using their inputs.

# ### Example Output:
# ```
# Enter a name: Jake
# Enter an animal: Tiger
# Enter a place: Jungle
# Once upon a time, Jake found a friendly Tiger in the Jungle. They became best friends!
# ```

# ## Submission

# Save your Python script as `input_practice.py` and submit it when done.
