# Assignment: Boolean Expressions in Python

# Instructions:
# Complete the exercises below by writing Python code that uses Boolean expressions.
# Save and run your script to test your answers.
# """

# # Task 1: Simple Comparisons
# # Fill in the blanks with the correct comparison operators to make the statements True.
# a = 10
# b = 5
# c = 10

# task_1a = (a ___ b)  # Should be True
# task_1b = (a ___ c)  # Should be True
# task_1c = (b ___ a)  # Should be False

# print("Task 1 Results:", task_1a, task_1b, task_1c)

# # Task 2: Logical Operators
# # Predict the output before running the code
# x = True
# y = False

# task_2a = x and y  # Predict: ?
# task_2b = x or y   # Predict: ?
# task_2c = not x    # Predict: ?

# print("Task 2 Results:", task_2a, task_2b, task_2c)

# # Task 3: Using Boolean Expressions in Conditionals
# # Complete the if-else statements to print the correct message
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# if age ___ 18:  # Fill in the correct operator
#     print("You are an adult.")
# else:
#     print("You are a minor.")

# # Task 4: Truthy and Falsy Values
# # Predict if each value will be considered True or False
# values = [0, 1, "", "hello", [], [1, 2, 3], {}, {"key": "value"}, None]
# results = [bool(value) for value in values]

# print("Task 4 Results:", results)
