# Honors Python Programming 1
## Course Overview

## Unit 1: Getting Started & Basic Python Concepts
### Topics
- Quick Python setup (installing Python, IDE/text editors)
- Basic Python syntax: `print()`, running scripts vs. interactive shell
- Variables and naming conventions
- Fundamental data types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`
- Type casting and type checking
- Basic input/output (`input()` function)

### Learning Objectives
- Install or confirm Python installation and run a simple “Hello, World!” program
- Understand how variables store data in Python
- Differentiate between `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `str`
- Practice reading user input and printing results to the console

## Placeholder for Unit 2

## Unit 3: Control Flow – Conditionals and Loops
### Topics
- Boolean expressions (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `and`, `or`, `not`)
- If statements, if-elif-else structure
- While loops
- For loops and the `range()` function

### Learning Objectives
- Write conditional statements to handle different scenarios
- Construct loop structures to handle repetitive tasks
- Use comparison and logical operators to guide program flow

---

## Unit 4: Functions and Code Organization
### Topics
- Defining functions (`def`)
- Function parameters and return values
- Variable scope (local vs. global)
- Organizing code with modules and imports

### Learning Objectives
- Create reusable code blocks with functions
- Pass arguments and return results effectively
- Understand Python’s import system to keep code modular

---

## Unit 5: Data Structures – Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries
### Topics
- Lists and list operations (indexing, slicing, appending, removing)
- Tuples (immutable lists)
- Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
- Iterating over collections

### Learning Objectives
- Store and manipulate ordered data with lists
- Understand differences between lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Write loops that iterate over these data structures effectively

---

## Unit 6: Working with Files and External Data
### Topics
- Reading from and writing to files (text, CSV)
- Handling exceptions (`try`, `except`)
- Basic error handling principles
- Introduction to libraries (e.g., `json`, `csv`)

### Learning Objectives
- Open, read, and write data to files safely
- Understand basics of error handling in Python
- Parse and generate CSV or JSON data

---

## Unit 7: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
### Topics
- Basic OOP concepts (classes, objects)
- Defining classes (`__init__`, attributes, methods)
- Creating and using objects
- (Optional) Basic inheritance

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental principles of OOP in Python
- Define simple classes with attributes and methods
- Create and manipulate objects to solve problems

---

## Unit 8: Additional Python Tools & Best Practices
### Topics
- Virtual environments and package management (pip)
- Debugging and logging
- Basic testing with `unittest` or `pytest`
- (Optional) A preview of external libraries (e.g., `matplotlib`, `pandas`)

### Learning Objectives
- Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies
- Employ basic debugging techniques and log messages
- Write simple test cases to validate functions
- Explore Python’s ecosystem of third-party packages
