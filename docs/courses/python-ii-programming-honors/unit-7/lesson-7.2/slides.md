# Warmup

```python
thanksgiving_dishes = {
    "turkey": "A roasted bird that is the centerpiece of most Thanksgiving meals.",
    "stuffing": "A seasoned mixture of bread, vegetables, and spices, often cooked inside the turkey.",
    "mashed potatoes": "Creamy potatoes mashed with butter and sometimes garlic.",
    "pumpkin pie": "A sweet dessert made with a spiced pumpkin filling in a pie crust."
}
```
