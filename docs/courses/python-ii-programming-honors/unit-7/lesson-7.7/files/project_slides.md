# Unit Project (Perform Grade) Finch Maze Navigation Project

**Objective**: Write a program to navigate a maze using the BirdBrain Finch robot.

- **Goal**: Program the Finch to autonomously navigate a physical maze from start to finish.
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - Problem-solving
  - Programming logic
  - Sensor usage
  - Debugging and testing
- **Due Date**: *End of Class* Friday 11/29/24

# **Project Requirements**

1. **Maze Design**:
   - Maze will be provided by the instructor or created by students (with approval).
   - Must include at least 3 turns.
2. **Programming**:
   - Use [Python/Java/Scratch] to program the Finch.
   - Leverage Finch's sensors (e.g., light, obstacle detection) to navigate.
3. **Autonomous Navigation**:
   - The Finch must complete the maze without human intervention.
   - No manual controls are allowed.
4. **Presentation**:
   - Record or demonstrate the Finch navigating the maze.
   - Explain your code and logic.

# **Grading Criteria**

**Total**: 100 Points

# **Suggested Approach**

1. **Understand the Finch's Capabilities**:
   - Review how to use sensors and movement commands.
2. **Plan the Maze Logic**:
   - Sketch the maze and identify possible solutions.
   - Plan how sensors will detect walls, turns, and endpoints.
3. **Write Incremental Code**:
   - Start with basic movements (e.g., move forward, turn).
   - Add sensor-based obstacle detection.
4. **Test and Debug**:
   - Test your program on smaller parts of the maze.
   - Adjust for speed, sensor sensitivity, and accuracy.

# **Example Techniques**

- **Obstacle Avoidance**:
  - Use the Finchâ€™s obstacle sensors to detect walls and stop or turn.
- **Line Following (Optional)**:
  - If the maze includes lines, use light sensors for navigation.
- **Decision Making**:
  - Implement if/else logic for handling intersections and dead ends.

# **Tips for Success**

1. **Start Simple**:
   - Focus on navigating one section of the maze before tackling the full challenge.
1. **Test Incrementally**:
   - Regularly test your code to identify issues early.
1. **Work as a Team**:
   - Collaborate and brainstorm ideas with your peers.
1. **Document Your Code**:
   - Add comments to explain how each part of your program works.

# **Submission Guidelines**

- **What to Submit**:
  1. Source code file(s).
  2. A short video of the Finch navigating the maze.
  3. A written explanation (or recorded presentation) of your approach.
- **Submission Format**:
  - Upload files to Canvas Assignment
- **Deadline**:
