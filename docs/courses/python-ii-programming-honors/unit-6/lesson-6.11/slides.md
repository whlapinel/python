# Warmup

- Create a DataFrame with the following data:

```python
Name        Department    Salary
John        HR            50000
Alice       IT            75000
Bob         IT            70000
Sarah       Marketing     60000
Mike        HR            55000
```

Using pandas, answer these questions:

- What is the average salary for each department?
- Who has the highest salary?
- Filter the employees with a salary greater than 60,000.
- Make a bar chart
