# Warmup

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

data = {
    "Names": ["John", "Rebecca"],
    "Points": [54, 67]
}
```

- Create a dataframe from the dictionary above (or something like it)
- Plot a bar chart with names on x and points on y
- Label the axes and give it a title

# Agenda

- Lots to do:
  - PE2 Module 3 Quiz due today
  - PE2 Module 3 Test due tomorrow
  - Unit 6 Project due tomorrow (perform grade)

# Session 10: Capstone Project

## Applying Data Science in Real-World Scenarios

# Capstone Project Overview

Today, you will begin your Capstone Project, which is an opportunity to apply everything you've learned in this course to a real-world problem or dataset of your choice.

# Project Guidelines

- Select a dataset that interests you (see end of this slide deck for suggestions). This could be related to sports, finance, health, economics, or any other field.
- Define clear objectives for your analysis. What questions are you trying to answer? What insights are you aiming to extract?

# Expected Deliverables

- A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that includes:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Exploratory data analysis with visualizations.
  - Advanced analysis (e.g., time series analysis, regression models).
  - A conclusion section with your findings.

# Project Phases

1. **Proposal Submission**: Outline your project idea, dataset, and objectives.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handle missing data, outliers, and preprocess data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use visualizations to understand the data.
4. **Advanced Analysis**: Apply more complex techniques like machine learning or time series forecasting.
5. **Presentation**: Prepare a presentation summarizing your analysis and findings.

# Resources and Support

- You have access to all the tools and libraries discussed during the course.
- Feel free to use online resources, but ensure your work is original and cite any sources.

# Timeline

- **Week 1**: Proposal submission and start data preparation.
- **Week 2**: Main analysis and draft completion of the notebook.
- **Final Day**: Presentation of your findings and submission of the final report.

# Tips for Success

- Start by understanding your dataset thoroughly.
- Break down your tasks into manageable segments.
- Regularly document your findings and challenges.

# Next Steps

Start by drafting a project proposal that includes:

- A brief description of the dataset.
- The main objectives of your project.
- Any initial hypotheses or questions you aim to explore.
